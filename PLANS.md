# Project Three Future Plans
In the future we plan to incorporate an admin feature into our project. After
thinking about ways to go about it, we realized it would take substantial work
to incorporate. However, for a future release, it is definitely possible. The
admin privileges would be added based on who created the party allowing them
to give peers ability to stop, play, and pause the YouTube video. Another
feature we think would benefit our project greatly would be the ability to
click on recommended YouTube videos. Once the selected video finishes or stops
playing, there are recommended videos at the bottom of the screen able to be
viewed. They, however, take you to the YouTube site. We think it would be very
cool and beneficial if users in the party could select one and have it play
through our application.
